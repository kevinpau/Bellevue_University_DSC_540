# Name: Kevin Paulovici<br>
# Date: 2/29/2020<br>
# Course: DSC 540 Data Preparation (2203-1)<br>
# Assignment: Final Project

#%%[markdown]
# ## Project Outline
# During the course, you will be working on a term project to either pull data from an API or scrape a webpage. You will need to select either an API (different than Twitter) or a Webpage and create a process in Python that will extract data into a formatted dataset. <br><br>
# Part 1: Your formatted dataset with at least 15-20 variables (if the API or Webpage you selected doesnâ€™t have that many fields available on it, you will want to search again, or do multiple!) <br> <br>
# Part 2: Your code or screenshots of your code outlining the steps and process you had to take to pull data from the API or web page and the steps you took to format the data.<br><br>
# Part 3: 2 Data Transformation/Clean-up Steps (can be any that we learned in class)<br><br>
# Part 4: A 250-word paper summarizing your steps and any challenges you ran into during the project. Discuss the importance and relevance of this type of process if you were a data scientist. How often do you think you would have to do this to get the data you need?

# ### Overview
# I'll be working with the https://openweathermap.org/api for this project. <br><br>
# I'll make the assumption that the user will use a zip code from the US to request weather data. Some checks will ensure a valid zip code is provided. <br><br>
# Select variables will be collected from the api, data will be cleaned and transformed into a more usable format (e.g., csv/json/excel)

# %% [markdown]
# ### Part 1

# a) Start by requesting a zip code from the user.

# ### Part 2

# Part 1 steps a through e explain step by step the process to retrieve data from the weather API based on a zip code. The data cleaning and transformations are included in this step and will be further explain in Part 3 and 4.


# %% [markdown]
# ### Part 3

# The data transformations were to 1) clean up the dates from Part 1 step d, and 2) transform the headers in Part 1 step e.
